 * Applies the pronunciation dictionary to the text: each `term` is replaced by its

 * Boundaries: uses zero-width lookarounds (same unicode style as `isBlocked`, but
 * WITHOUT consuming the boundary characters) so that repeated or adjacent terms
 * are all replaced — unlike `isBlocked`, whose pattern consumes the
 * boundary and is safe only because it just does `.test()`.
 *
 * Applied AFTER `cleanText` and BEFORE synth. The residual whitespace from an
 * empty replacement is not re-collapsed (cleanText already ran).
