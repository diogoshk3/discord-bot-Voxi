// src/tts/engineLabels.ts — the ONE place that turns a stored engine id into the name a
// user reads. It existed in four hand-written copies (the /voice set confirmation, the
// /voice config panel summary, the panel's select options, and the command choices), and
// two of them had already drifted: the panel called the default "Default (local)" while
// /voice set called the same engine "Google".
//
// "Google" was not just inconsistent, it was wrong: the stored value 'google' is the
// LEGACY name for "whatever the operator configured as the default" — local Piper unless
// changed (see store/userVoice.ts) — so the old copy told people they were on Google TTS
// when they were not. The default label is therefore localized (it describes a role);
// the other three are product names and stay as-is in every language.
