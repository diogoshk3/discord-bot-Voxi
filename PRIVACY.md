# Privacy Policy — Vozen

> _type it, hear it._

**Last updated:** 2026-07-22

Vozen is an **open-source**, **self-hosted** Text-to-Speech (TTS) bot for Discord: each operator runs their own instance on their own computer or server (VPS). This policy describes **faithfully** what data the instance stores, where, and how to remove it.

Because Vozen is self-hosted, the **data controller is the instance operator** (the person or entity running the bot), not the project authors. The operator directly controls the database file and the cache folder on their system.

## 1. What data is stored

Vozen stores the data below in a local **SQLite** database (by default `tts.db`, configurable via `DB_PATH`). Records are keyed mainly by **numeric Discord IDs** (snowflakes) — `guild_id` (server) and `user_id` (user). Those identifiers and the records linked to them can be personal data even though they are not names. Vozen does not normally store your email, phone number, postal address, Discord username, or avatar. Two narrow additions are: (1) the optional **spoken nickname** (`/voice nickname`), which is free text and may contain a name; and (2) for Ko-fi purchases, a **keyed one-way hash** of the buyer's email (never the plaintext email), used solely to link purchases and renewals to the same Discord account. For instant activation, Discord supplies the verified email of the signed-in account with the user's OAuth permission; Vozen hashes it in memory and immediately discards both the email and the transient hash.

Note on opt-out: running `/voice optout` **creates** a record with your `user_id` (so the bot remembers the preference). `/voice optin` removes that record. No other information about you is stored.

### 1.1 Website login (vozen.org)

When you log in on **vozen.org** with Discord (the account page and the server dashboard), Vozen uses Discord OAuth2 and requests only:

- **`identify`** — your Discord ID, username and avatar, to show your account and to verify that a request is really yours.
- **`email`** (account page) — the verified email on your Discord account, used only when you request instant Ko-fi activation. Vozen computes the same keyed hash used by the Ko-fi receipt in memory, then immediately discards the email and transient hash. Neither is stored, cached, or logged.
- **`guilds`** (server dashboard only) — the **list of servers you belong to**, used solely to show which servers you can configure (those where you have **Manage Server** and Vozen is present). Vozen never posts, leaves, or changes anything about those servers from this list.

The basic profile and server-list data are used **transiently** to answer the request and are **not stored** in the database — they may be held in memory for at most ~60 seconds (a short cache) and then discarded. The activation email path is deliberately uncached: the verified email and its transient hash exist only for that activation request and are never written to disk or logs. The access token stays in **your browser** (`sessionStorage`), is sent only to Vozen's own API over HTTPS, and is never written to disk on our side. A one-shot activation intent (containing no email) may also remain in `sessionStorage` for up to five minutes during Discord reauthorization. The dashboard only changes the same per-server settings you could change with `/config` in Discord.

For instant activation, processing the verified Discord email is necessary to perform the activation the user requests (GDPR Art. 6(1)(b), or Art. 6(1)(f) where the service is not contractual). The minimum activation-consent and transaction records are retained under applicable legal obligations and legitimate interests in accounting, fraud prevention, and resolving disputes (Art. 6(1)(c)/(f)).

### 1.2 Operator admin console

The instance **operator** (and only the operator — access is gated by the owner's
Discord identity plus a server-only signed session) has a private admin console to
run the service. It shows: active Premium/Plus entitlements and pending purchases
(to grant or revoke them); per server, the server's name, icon, member count,
**aggregate `talk_stats`** — the total number of messages the bot has read, the
number of active speakers, the top five speakers as `(Discord ID, count)`; the
dominant **language and TTS engine** for each global top talker, calculated from
aggregate `talk_usage` counters; and a
**server activity streak** (how many consecutive days at least one person spoke — a
server-level counter, not per-person); and a **global "top talkers" list** — the ten
people with the most messages read across all servers, shown with their Discord
username and avatar (fetched live from Discord's public profile for display, not
stored).

This introduces **no new data collection and no new recipient**: the figures are
**counts, never message content**, computed from `talk_stats` and `talk_usage` already
described in the table above; the server streak is a consecutive-day counter derived from the same
activity, holding no per-person data; the username and avatar in the top-talkers list
are the person's **public** Discord profile, fetched live for display and never
stored; the same top-speaker data is already public in each server via `/topspeakers`;
and the operator already controls the database directly (see §3).
The console is only an owner-facing view over data that is already disclosed,
already deletable via `/privacy erase`, and already auto-deleted 30 days after the
bot leaves a server (§3).

---

## 2. Message content

To synthesize speech, Vozen **reads the text content** of messages in the cases where it acts: the `/tts` command, auto-reading a configured channel, and mentions/replies to the bot.

**Message text is NOT stored in any database table.** It is processed **transiently** in memory: text cleaning → applying the pronunciation dictionary → checking the blocklist → speech synthesis → playback. After playback, the plain text is not persisted anywhere.

### 2.1 Audio cache

To avoid re-synthesizing repeated phrases, Vozen stores the **generated audio files** (`.wav`) in a local cache folder (`audio-cache/`, next to the database). It is important to understand exactly what this implies:

- **The key (file name) is a** `SHA-1` **content identifier** computed from `cleaned_text + voice_model + speed`. The plain text does not appear in the file name or database. This hash is not encryption and must not be treated as a security boundary; the cached audio itself reveals the spoken content.
- **However, the `.wav` file itself is the spoken audio of the cleaned message.** Anyone with access to the instance's file system can play that file and hear the content. This is not a "hiding place" for the content — it is simply the generated audio, stored for reuse.
- The cache is **limited and regenerable**: by default it keeps at most ~500 files per engine (a count-based limit — the oldest by creation date are deleted first). It **persists on disk** across bot restarts until evicted by the limit policy, or until the operator deletes the folder. If deleted, the audio is simply re-synthesized when needed.

In short: **we do not store the original text**, only the generated audio keyed by hash, which is limited, regenerable, and deletable.

### 2.1.1 Explicit audio-file exports

`/tts-file` is an explicit request to generate a short audio attachment. It does **not** join a
voice channel or play audio to anyone. Vozen may reuse its normal local audio cache to create the
file, but copies the result to a private opaque temporary location only for Discord's upload and
deletes that temporary copy immediately after the delivery attempt, including when delivery fails.
It does not create a public URL, a persistent download record, or a database row for the export.

The explicit **Transcribe voice message** action accepts only supported audio hosted on Discord's
CDN. Vozen enforces HTTPS host allow-listing, media type, byte, decoded-duration and timeout limits,
disables redirects, decodes to a short-lived local WAV, transcribes locally, and deletes the
temporary directory after the attempt. The result is returned ephemerally to the requester. This
one-shot action does not listen to a call and is separate from live `/transcribe` consent.

Vozen writes **operational logs** to the console/terminal and (in the production runner) to the file `logs/vozen.log` next to the executable, with size-based rotation. The logs contain operational information: level, timestamp, command names, and error messages. **The logs do NOT include the content of users' messages.** Log retention is controlled by the instance operator (the system where the bot runs).

### 2.2.1 Identity-free operational aggregates

When the optional paid Google HD engine is configured and makes a real provider request, Vozen also stores small **daily service aggregates** in its local SQLite database: UTC day, fixed metric name, provider label, and a numeric total. These cover successful and failed synthesis attempts, fallback events, provider-call latency, and provider-charged character totals. A separate provider-health row stores only the provider label, its current health state, and health/degradation timestamps.

These operational rows do **not** contain message text, generated audio, Discord user or server IDs, channel IDs, OAuth tokens, request bodies, raw provider errors, or any link to a person. They are therefore not user- or guild-scoped records and cannot be selected by `/privacy erase`; the instance operator may purge them as part of normal operational retention. No public status endpoint is enabled by this telemetry.

### 2.2.2 Optional channel translation

Automatic channel translation is **off by default**. A server administrator must explicitly configure a
source text channel, a distinct destination text channel and a target locale, then enable the
feature with `/translate`. Vozen processes only the current message in that configured source
channel. Separately, a user may explicitly run `/translate text` or the **Translate** message action
in a server, DM or User App context; only the text they selected is processed and the result is
ephemeral. No mode translates attachments, embeds, message history, voice audio or transcripts.

Before an external provider call, Discord mentions are reduced to generic display-safe labels and
Vozen sends only the current plain text plus the requested target locale. It does not send the
author, server, channel, message URL, attachments, surrounding chat, or Discord identifiers to the
provider. Source text and translated text are not stored in Vozen's SQLite database or its metrics.
Mappings, personal target-language preferences, an optional member opt-out and bounded rolling **30-day** character counters are stored
only to operate the opt-in feature; these are removed by the server reset/removal lifecycle and by
`/privacy erase` where user-scoped. Translation output is a normal Discord message in the selected
destination channel, so Discord retention controls that posted message.

An instance has no translation provider until its operator configures one. Provider configuration
is never shown to ordinary members. Translation is text-only unless a member explicitly enables
their own translate-before-speaking preference in a server; that path still obeys Vozen's separate
same-call, role, rate-limit and queue authorization rules and falls back to the original text.

### 2.3 Speech-to-text / transcription (consent-first)

Transcription (`/transcribe`, a Premium feature) turns the speech in a voice channel into text messages. It is strictly **consent-first** and processes audio **locally** (a Whisper sidecar on the instance's machine — nothing is sent to an external service, nothing is used to train AI). How it works:

- **Consent first, per speaker.** Only people who have **explicitly consented** in that server are transcribed — an on-screen Allow button that **only that person** can press. Consent is asked **once per server** and remembered (`stt_consent` stores your user ID, the server ID and `consent_at`); people who never consent are simply **not transcribed** while the rest of the call continues. Revoking consent stops future transcription of you.
- **Audio is never persisted.** For each utterance the bot writes a **short-lived temporary file** (in the OS temp directory) that the local Whisper sidecar reads to produce text, then **deletes it immediately** afterwards. The audio is never kept, never added to any database table, and never sent to an external service.
- **The bot announces transcription** in the channel when it **starts and stops**, and **auto-stops** when nobody consented remains in the call.
- **Transcriptions are normal Discord messages — and therefore permanent.** The text the bot posts lives in the channel like any other message. This means it is **outside `/privacy erase`** (which only removes data from the bot's own database, not messages already posted to Discord). Revoking consent stops new transcriptions but does **not** retroactively delete messages already posted; to remove those, delete the messages in Discord (or ask a server moderator to). Only the **consent record** (`stt_consent`) is bot-side data, and that is removed by `/privacy erase`.

> Compliance note: transcribing a person's speech acts on that person, so it requires their explicit prior consent (handled above). The instance operator is responsible for honoring consent and removal requests.

## 3. Data retention and deletion

Because Vozen is self-hosted, **the instance operator directly controls** the SQLite file (`DB_PATH`) and the cache folder (`audio-cache/`) — both are local files that can be deleted at any time. On a Docker deployment, deleting everything is `docker compose down -v` (removes the volume with the database and the cache).

For users and server administrators, the bot's commands allow data to be removed:

| To remove...                    | Use...                           | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Your voice preference           | `/voice reset`                   | Deletes your record in `user_voice`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Your spoken nickname            | `/voice nickname` (with no name) | Deletes your record in `user_nickname`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Your opt-out (be read again)    | `/voice optin`                   | Deletes your record in `tts_optout`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Your transcription consent      | `/transcribe revoke`             | Deletes your row in `stt_consent`; you stop being transcribed. Messages already posted are normal Discord messages (delete in Discord).                                                                                                                     |
| Server configuration            | `/config reset`                  | Restores `guild_config` to its default values. **Note:** the reset does **NOT** clear the blocklist or the pronunciation dictionary.                                                                                                                        |
| A word from the blocklist       | `/config blockword remove`       | Removed individually (not by `/config reset`).                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| A pronunciation term            | `/config pronunciation remove`   | Removed individually (not by `/config reset`).                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Your erasable personal data** | `/privacy erase`                 | One command (asks you to confirm). Deletes personal settings, preferences, consent, scores, `talk_stats`, and `talk_usage` tied to your user ID across **all** servers. Paid rights and minimum financial records follow the separate retention rule below. |

> **To delete your erasable personal data, use `/privacy erase`** — it asks you to confirm, then removes personal settings, preferences, consent, scores, `talk_stats`, `talk_usage`, and any active free vote entitlement tied to your user ID across every server (`user_voice`, `user_nickname`, `user_abbreviation`, `pronunciation_user`, `user_effect`, `tts_optout`, `stt_consent`, `game_score`, `talk_stats`, `talk_usage`, `user_birthday`, `vote_reward`, and the other user-scoped operational records listed above). Transcription text already posted to a channel is a normal Discord message, not bot-side data (see section 2.3). Erasure does **not** reset eligibility for the one-time promotion: the keyed pseudonymous HMAC marker is retained for anti-abuse while that promotion operates. Active paid entitlements and the minimum purchase and activation-consent records needed for accounting, fraud prevention, disputes, and legal obligations may also be retained. Retained records are restricted to those purposes and deleted or anonymized when no longer necessary; contact the operator to exercise a legal right.

The audio cache is regenerable and self-limiting (see section 2.1); deleting it loses no configuration.

**Automatic retention limit (servers).** When Vozen is removed from a server, that server's data (configuration, blocklist, pronunciations, stats, scores, per-user voice settings for that server, etc.) is **automatically deleted 30 days later** if the bot is not re-invited. The 30-day grace period exists so an accidental kick or a short outage does not wipe everything immediately; re-inviting the bot within that window cancels the deletion. An active paid entitlement and the minimum payment ledger required for accounting, fraud prevention, disputes, or law may be retained for those purposes only and removed or anonymized when the applicable period ends.

## 4. Third parties

### 4.1 Speech synthesis engine (where the text goes)

To generate the audio, the **cleaned text to be synthesized** is handed to a TTS engine. Which one depends on the instance's `TTS_ENGINE` configuration:

| `TTS_ENGINE` | Where the text goes                                                                                                                        | Note                                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `piper`      | **Stays local** — runs on the instance's machine, **sends nothing external**.                                                              | Code default.                                                         |
| `gtts`       | **Sent to Google** (`translate.google.com`) to generate the audio. [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) applies. | Legacy, explicit operator opt-in; this is not an official Google API. |
| `router`     | By default uses **gTTS (Google)** and falls back to **Piper (local)** if Google fails — that is, the text **may** be sent to Google.       | —                                                                     |
| `neural`     | **Sent to OpenAI** (`api.openai.com`). Requires the operator's API key.                                                                    | Opt-in.                                                               |

> In every case, **only the text to be read** (already cleaned) is sent, not user IDs or history. The external engine returns audio; Vozen does not store the text↔user association.

### 4.2 Other services

- **Discord.** Vozen connects to Discord's API/gateway to work (receiving messages, joining voice channels, responding). Use of Discord is governed by [Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).
- **Bot lists (opt-in, e.g. top.gg).** If `TOPGG_TOKEN` is set, Vozen publishes only its **server count**. When someone votes, top.gg sends Vozen that voter's Discord user ID in a signed webhook. An eligible account receives one **48h Plus** reward ever. The raw ID is kept only for the active entitlement; a keyed one-way HMAC marker prevents repeat claims without retaining the raw ID. No message content is shared.
- **Error webhook (opt-in).** If `ERROR_WEBHOOK_URL` is set, technical error reports (stack traces) are sent to a private **operator** channel for monitoring. They are not designed to include message content.
- **Activation-help webhook (opt-in).** If you use the "get help" option on the account page (when you cannot activate a purchase yourself), the **email address you enter** and your Discord ID are sent to a private **operator** channel so the operator can find your Ko-fi order and activate your pass by hand. This is the one case where an email you type is transmitted (not stored in the database); it is used only to locate your order for that support request. Requires `CLAIM_HELP_WEBHOOK_URL` (or `ERROR_WEBHOOK_URL`) to be set — otherwise nothing is sent.
- **Operator admin console (opt-in).** The operator may enable a private admin console (the `/api/admin/*` routes, gated by the operator's own Discord login — only the owner's Discord identity may enter) to grant/revoke Premium and to view **aggregate usage per server**: the server's name and icon (from Discord), how many messages Vozen has read there, top talkers, and each global top talker's dominant language and TTS engine from the `talk_usage` counters. These are counts, never message content. User-scoped `talk_stats` and `talk_usage` are removed by `/privacy erase`; server-scoped rows are removed by the automatic purge after the bot leaves a server. Inert unless the `ADMIN_*` env vars are configured.
- **Optional translation provider.** If an operator explicitly configures Azure-compatible text translation, the current plain text from an administrator-configured source channel and its target locale are sent to that provider solely to produce the translated text. It remains disabled without complete operator configuration; no message history, IDs, attachments, embeds or voice data are sent.

**No data sale. No third-party analytics. No trackers.** Vozen does not sell, rent, or share data with third parties for marketing purposes, and does not integrate external analytics services.

### 4.3 Children and US privacy requests

Vozen is not directed to children under 13 (or a higher local minimum age). If an operator learns that an underage child supplied personal data, the operator must stop the relevant processing and delete it unless retention is legally required. A parent or guardian may contact the operator using section 5.

Where US state privacy law applies, residents may request access, correction, deletion, or a portable copy and may appeal a refusal by contacting the operator. Vozen does not sell personal data, share it for cross-context behavioural advertising, run targeted advertising, or discriminate against a person for exercising a privacy right. An authorised agent may submit a request where local law permits, subject to identity and authority verification.

## 5. Contact / Responsible party

The **responsible party** for a Vozen instance is the **operator** who runs it. For questions about your data on a specific server, to report a problem/abuse, or to request the removal of your data, contact that server's administrator or the bot's operator.

> **Official public Vozen instance:**
>
> - Support / reports / data requests: **[support server](https://discord.gg/4kYw2WUbNN)** (`discord.gg/4kYw2WUbNN`)
> - Source code: <https://github.com/Rexy40407/discord-bot-Vozen>
>
> **Running your own instance?** Replace the contact above with your own before making the bot public.

The Vozen project authors provide only the software (open-source); each operator of a third-party instance is responsible for the data that instance processes.

---

## Nota / Note (EN)

_Vozen is a self-hosted, open-source Discord TTS bot (AGPL-3.0). The instance operator is the data controller. The bot stores Discord numeric IDs plus the preferences and service records described above. Message text is processed transiently and is not stored in a database table; generated audio is kept only in a bounded, regenerable cache. Where text goes depends on `TTS_ENGINE`: Piper is local; legacy gTTS/router modes may send text to Google; neural sends text to OpenAI; Premium Google HD uses the official Google Cloud TTS API. Transcription is consent-first and local on the configured instance. Vozen does not sell data, run third-party advertising analytics, or use message content for model training. Use `/privacy erase` to delete your data, or contact the [support server](https://discord.gg/4kYw2WUbNN) to request access to a copy of it or exercise any other data right._
